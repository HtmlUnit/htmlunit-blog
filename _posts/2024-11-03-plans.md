Last week i had a plan for this week - working on htmx.

But guess what happens :-).

Spend some time on htmlunit- driver improvements. Beside of some fixes i made also the relative locator support working.
Relative locators are evaluated by a complex (and minified) js that tries to work based on the layout. With a minor fix
for the script itself and some infrastructure and an improvement for Htmlunit if got it working.

And then csware was able to provide some more details for issue #837. Changing my plan again and build a reproducible test
case and also fixing the issue (regression from 4.4.0).

And finally the new selenium version appears so i made the plan to do a Htmlunit and Htmlunit-Driver release this weekend.

Yesterday i started the build train but i stuck already at the first step - the sonatype web page produces regular timeouts.
This happens from time to time, and they have to restart the page after some cleanup.

Will wait for the page...

No, no, no - there is no plan for the next week.

Stay tuned
