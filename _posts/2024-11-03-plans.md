Last week I had a plan for this week - working on htmx.

But guess what happens :-).

Spend some time on htmlunit-driver improvements. Beside of some fixes, I made also the relative locator support working.
Relative locators are evaluated by a complex (and minified) js that tries to work based on the layout. With a minor fix
for the script itself and some infrastructure and an improvement for Htmlunit if got it working.

And then csware was able to provide some more details for issue #837. Changing my plan again and build a reproducible test
case and also fixed the issue (regression from 4.4.0).

And then the new selenium version was released. I made the new plan to do a HtmlUnit and HtmlUnit-Driver release this weekend.

Yesterday I started the build but it stopped already at the first step - the sonatype web page produces regular timeouts.
This happens from time to time, and they have to restart the page after some cleanup.

Will wait for that...

No, no, no - there is no plan for the next week.

Stay tuned
