### 4.7.0
Yes the next release is out.
As usual I have done the Chrome/Edge 131, Firefox 133 resync and a bunch of fixes/improvments.
Rhino is still very active, this time the String.prototype.matchAll, Symbol.matchAll, and RegExp.prototype[Symbol.matchAll] where added.

### 4.27.0
To stay in sync with the Selenium updates a new HtmlUnitDriver was also released.

### > 16k
Github reports HtmlUnit is used by more than 16700 projects. I spent some time writing a short crawler to get an overview about the most important ones.
You can find a short list now in the [README](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit?tab=readme-ov-file#features)

Stay tuned
