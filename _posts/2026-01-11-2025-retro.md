As we step into 2026, it's time to look back at an incredibly productive year for HtmlUnit and the wider ecosystem. 2025 was marked by significant technical achievements, strengthened collaborations, and growing adoption.    Let me share some highlights from this exciting journey.

## HtmlUnit's Steady Evolution

Throughout 2025, I released 13 versions of HtmlUnit (from 4.10.  0 to 4.21.0), each bringing meaningful improvements and new features to our users. 
Here are some of the major milestones:

### Browser Compatibility

I kept pace with the rapidly evolving browser landscape:   
- **Chrome/Edge**: Updated support from version 133 through 143
- **Firefox**: Maintained compatibility from version 135 to 146
- **Firefox ESR**: Updated to version 140

### Major Features & Improvements

**New Sister Project**: I launched [jsoup-bridge](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit?    tab=readme-ov-file#jsoup-bridge), expanding HtmlUnit's ecosystem and providing better integration options.

**Testing Infrastructure**: I migrated the entire test suite to JUnit 5, modernizing the testing approach and improving maintainability.

**Neko HTML Parser**:  Numerous improvements to the HTML parser, including:   
- Better spec conformance for comment end detection
- Improved handling of formatting elements
- EOF handling refactored from exceptions to return codes
- Performance optimizations

Beyond these highlights, each release included **continuous** minor improvements, browser compatibility updates, and bug fixes to ensure HtmlUnit stays reliable and up-to-date with the latest web standards.

### Developer Experience

I didn't forget about the developers using HtmlUnit: 
- Published comprehensive SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) in CycloneDX format
- Created separate developer documentation to help new contributors
- Migrated to Sonatype central-publishing for snapshots and releases
- Reduced dependencies (Apache commons-codec is no longer a runtime dependency)

## The Rhino Revolution:    Over 130 Improvements

Perhaps the most exciting area of progress was our JavaScript engine.    Thanks to the outstanding **Rhino Team** and their exceptional collaboration, we achieved more than 130 improvements in our core-js implementation.  The synergy with the Rhino team has been nothing short of amazing.  I'm particularly proud of contributing [more than 55 commits to Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/graphs/contributors?from=1.1.2025) myself.

### RegExp Support:    A Complete Overhaul

The regular expression support received massive attention: 
- **Named capture groups**: Finally supported for modern JavaScript patterns
- **RegExp lookbehind**:  Completing the lookaround support
- **Unicode mode**:  Better handling of Unicode in regular expressions
- **Complete reimplementation** of `String.prototype.search`, `replace`, `replaceAll`, and `split` - much closer to spec now
- **Sticky flag behavior** fixed
- **Symbol.match** implemented

We switched back from our custom RegExp translation to using core Rhino's significantly improved implementation.   

### Modern JavaScript Support

- **Spread operator**:  Support for spread in arrays and object literals
- **Rest parameters**:  Handling of unimplemented rest parameters in destructuring
- **Destructuring**:  Improved support including in catch blocks and for-loops
- **Generator improvements**:  Symbol.toStringTag, default parameter evaluation ordering
- **Symbol enhancements**:  Better global symbol registry handling
- **ES2025 Features**:  Promise.try(), Promise.withResolvers(), ArrayBuffer.transfer() , ArrayBuffer.transferToFixedLength() and the Set methods intersection(), union(), difference(), symmetricDifference(), isSubsetOf(), isSupersetOf(), and isDisjointFrom()

### Performance & Architecture

- **Interpreter performance**:  Massive improvements by avoiding the need for activation frames
- **Lambda-based refactoring**: Converted numerous core classes (NativeObject, NativeArray, NativeString, NativeGlobal, Function, BigInt, Boolean, Number, Map, Set, and many more) from IdScriptableObject to lambda-based implementations
- **Optimizations**: SlotMap handling, 'undefined' lookup, and function name inference
- **Schubfach algorithm**: Replaced NumberToString implementation for better performance

## Jenkins Collaboration:   Real-World Impact

Our collaboration with the Jenkins project yielded tangible benefits for their testing infrastructure:  

1. **CSS Selector Support** ([#20](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit-cssparser/issues/20)): Implementation of modern `:has()`, `:is()`, and `:where()` pseudo-selectors.   

2. **Background JavaScript Optimization** ([#946](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-test-harness/issues/946)): We introduced `waitForBackgroundJavaScriptStartingBefore(long, long)` combining overall timeout with waiting for tasks starting before a specific time.  This single improvement **reduced the Jenkins team's overall test execution time by 1 hour** - a significant productivity boost.

3. **JavaScript 'caller' Handling** ([#1064](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit/issues/1064)): Improved the 'caller' property support to better match browser behavior, modernizing the approach and making it a function prototype property. 

These collaborations demonstrate HtmlUnit's real-world impact in enterprise CI/CD pipelines. 

## The Numbers

Since September 2025, I've been tracking download statistics through [Scarf](https://app.scarf.sh).   The numbers are impressive and show strong, sustained adoption:

| Month | neko-htmlunit | htmlunit | jsoup-bridge |
|-------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 2025-09 | 2,235,968 | 1,227,070 | 204 |
| 2025-10 | 3,577,443 | 1,820,794 | 490 |
| 2025-11 | 2,918,966 | 1,512,739 | 542 |
| 2025-12 | 2,495,485 | 1,381,064 | 807 |

That's **over 11.2 million downloads of neko-htmlunit** and **5.9 million downloads of htmlunit** in just four months!  The steady growth of the new jsoup-bridge project is also encouraging.

## My Open Source Activities

**Over 1,800 commits** throughout the year - averaging about 5 commits per day, every day. Looking back at the numbers, I'm a bit shocked myself by how many changes I've committed over the year.

## Looking Ahead

As I move into 2026, I'm already working on version 5.0.0 with an important change:  HtmlUnit will require **JDK 17** as the minimum version. This will help modernize the codebase and take advantage of modern Java features to improve performance and maintainability. 

## Support HtmlUnit

HtmlUnit is and will always be free and open source. However, maintaining and developing HtmlUnit requires significant time and effort. If you or your company benefit from HtmlUnit, please consider supporting the project:  

- **Sponsor on GitHub**:  Visit our [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/rbri) to provide financial support
- **Corporate sponsorship**: If your company relies on HtmlUnit for testing, consider becoming a regular sponsor
- **Contribute**:  Code contributions, bug reports, and documentation improvements are always welcome

Your support helps ensure HtmlUnit's continued development and keeps the project sustainable for the entire community. 

## Thank You

None of this would be possible without:
- The **Rhino Team** for their exceptional work and collaboration
- The **Jenkins team** for their partnership and real-world testing
- The entire **HtmlUnit community** for bug reports, feature requests, and contributions
- Everyone who downloads and uses HtmlUnit in their projects
- Our **sponsors** who provide financial support to keep this project thriving

Here's to an even more productive 2026!  🚀
