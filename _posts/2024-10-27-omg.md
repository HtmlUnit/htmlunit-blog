OMG!- The release is out and the whole webpage is a mess. Looks like one of these site updated generates breaks everything.
It's a nightmare to spend time on this.

Ok found a way to prevent this - going back with the site plugin to version 3.12.0 solves the problem for the moment.
Did also some testing with the lastest milestone release, but was not able to figure out a vaild combination of plugin
and theme. What a waste of time...

Spend this week (more or less) with some work on the htmlunit-driver. Finally found a simple way to make the Releativelocator's
working. As always, if you choose the right approach, it is simple.

And finally some performace improvements for the parsing process found there way into the code base. Had done some profiling
again and mabe found something to speed up.

And Rhino made some more progress, core-js is updated again.

For the next week, I like to work again on the Htmx support.

Stay tuned
