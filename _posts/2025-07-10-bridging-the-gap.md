# Bridging the Gap: HtmlUnit-jsoup Integration

As HtmlUnit continues to evolve as Java library for web automation and testing, we're constantly 
looking for ways to enhance the developer experience and expand the possibilities for our users.
Today, we're excited to showcase htmlunit-jsoup, a bridge library that opens up the entire jsoup
ecosystem to HtmlUnit developers.

## The jsoup Ecosystem Advantage

While HtmlUnit provides browser simulation capabilities, the jsoup ecosystem offers something
equally valuable: a vast collection of tools, utilities, and extensions built around 
jsoup's elegant parsing API. This includes:

 * Third-party Extensions: Hundreds of libraries built on jsoup's foundation
 * Community Tools: Specialized parsers, validators, and content extractors
 * Educational Resources: Extensive tutorials and examples using jsoup's syntax
 * Developer Familiarity: Many developers already know jsoup's jQuery-like API

## Getting Started
Ready to add this capability to your HtmlUnit project? 
Head over to the [htmlunit-jsoup](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit-jsoup) 
GitHub repository for complete installation instructions, usage examples, and the latest version information.
