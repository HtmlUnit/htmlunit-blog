Back from vacation I was suprised how many changes got into the Rhino codebase.
So i tried to catch the momentum and  get as many things done as possible. You can have a look at the 
latest [changes][https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit/blob/master/src/changes/changes.xml] to get an impression of what was done.

The downside of these focus switch is a delayed HtmlUnit release; sorry for that.

Currently I'm working on the Chrome/Edge/FF update to bring Htmlunit back in sync with the latest browser release.
Looks like some differences are fixed at both sides and i can remove some more switches from the code.

If everythig works well the release is planned for the weekend.


Stay tuned
