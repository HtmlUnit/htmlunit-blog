This was fast - a bit more than two weeks and another [release](https://www.htmlunit.org/changes-report.html#a4.6.0) is out.

No, this is not a hotfix, the short cycle was triggered by some neko changes and mainly by one fix required for the
[HtmlUnit 3 Driver 4.26.0] (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/htmlunit-driver/releases/tag/4.26.0). At least the stuff done for the
driver is major step forward. Some incompatibilities are fixed and finally releative locators are supported.

Developments goes on - did a lot of cleanup and minor fixes during the last days.

And finally - if you still think javascript is a serious programming langugage you have to read about
[Special type conversion behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAllCollection#special_type_conversion_behavior).
No idea how many pages out there are working based on this. [Fixed](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/pull/1721).

Stay tuned
